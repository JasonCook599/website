The repository is used to host my personal website. It is meant to serve as a landing page and create an online presence for myself and my business. This site uses the static site generator [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) and deploy to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/). We use [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) as the primary templating language.
